I am a PhD student working under the supervision of Asst.-Prof. Christian Baumgartner in the Lucerne Medical AI Lab.

My research mainly focuses on human-AI collaboration. My goal is to combine the expertise of humans with the powerful capabilities of deep learning models. For this collaboration to be safe and trustworthy, we need to understand when AI systems are uncertain or likely to make mistakes. Thatâ€™s why I aim to develop better ways to quantify and understand uncertainty in AI. In my past projects, I have explored performance prediction, uncertainty propagation and learning to defer.

I believe the most meaningful research happens when we work hand-in-hand with clinicians, listening to the challenges they face and exploring how AI might help. My previous collaborations have shown just how fruitful these partnerships can be.
