abstract: 'The accurate segmentation of the optic cup and disc in fundus images is essential for di- agnostic processes such as glaucoma detection. The inherent ambiguity in locating these structures often poses a significant challenge, leading to potential misdiagnosis. To model such ambiguities, numerous probabilistic segmentation models have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the integration of these probabilistic segmentation models into a mul- tistage pipeline closely resembling clinical practice. Our findings indicate that leveraging the uncertainties provided by these models substantially enhances the quality of glaucoma diagnosis compared to relying on a single segmentation only.'
